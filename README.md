## About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm Jack.

I'm journeying through the world of full-stack development, with a passion for creating technology that simplifies and enhances everyday life. I believe in building intuitive tools that automate the mundane, restore calm to our busy lives, and free up time for what makes us human.

🔍 While my creations often work quietly behind the scenes, I'm excited to share them with you here.

✨ Stay tuned for some more projects on the way!
